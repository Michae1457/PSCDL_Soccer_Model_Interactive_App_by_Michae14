## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Data not loaded" Error**
   - Ensure pipeline has been run successfully
   - Check that Statistics/ directory exists
   - Verify CSV files are present and readable

2. **Charts Not Displaying**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Plotly.js is loading correctly
   - Verify API endpoints are responding

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Large datasets may load slowly
   - Consider data filtering for better performance
   - Check server resources

4. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change port in `soccer_dashboard_app.py`
   - Kill existing Flask processes
   - Use different port: `app.run(port=5001)`

### **Debug Mode**
```python
# Enable debug mode in soccer_dashboard_app.py
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
